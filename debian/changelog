      winbind being pulled onto the CD images when it's not required.
    - debian/patches/stat_systemd-ask-password.patch: also check for
      /bin/systemd-ask-password before trying to use systemd's tools.
  * Dropped undocumented quilt dependancies wrt old debian format transition
    in debian/control and debian/rules, as those are not necessary anymore.

cifs-utils (2:4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial release, packaging imported from samba source. (Closes: #571969)
  * Rename binary package from smbfs to cifs-utils, but leave the "smbfs"
    tools under the smbfs name for later deprecation post-squeeze.
  * Drop the dependency on netbase, which has no reason given in the changelog
    and doesn't appear to be needed.
  * Adjust the language in debian/cifs-utils.NEWS to make clear the
    consequences of this change, and direct users to alternatives.
    Closes: #572691.
  * umount.cifs (and by extension, smbumount) no longer exists upstream,
    because mount.cifs no longer permits non-root users to mount except by
    way of the standard /etc/fstab arguments.
